# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command (implemented via `.specify/scripts/powershell/setup-plan.ps1`).

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.* Violations require entries in **Complexity Tracking**.

1. **Run-Ready Prototypes Only** – Document how this feature keeps `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm -r type-check` green (include affected packages, build order, and console-error mitigation).
2. **Single Design System Surface** – Confirm which `@prototipo/design-system` primitives or new tokens are involved, how `'use client'` boundaries are respected, and whether Shadcn UI stays inside `apps/studio/src/app/{studio,dashboard}/`.
3. **Documented Journeys Stay Traceable** – Identify the impacted `domains/{domain}/journeys/{journey}` docs, Studio slugs, dashboards, and sprint indexes that will be updated alongside the code.
4. **Typed APIs & Observable Dashboards** – Outline the contracts, TypeScript interfaces, telemetry, and `/api/health` or dashboard metrics that will change (or state “N/A” if no API touch).
5. **Automation-First Quality Gates** – Explain how plan/spec/tasks, `/spec` validation, and CI evidence will be produced for this work.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
